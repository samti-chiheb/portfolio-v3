# portfolio-v3

Welcome to my online portfolio! 
Here, I showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience through a modern and elegant interface.

Using the power of ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion, I've created a stunning 3D graphics library that brings my content to life. 

With this project, I've learned how to load, create, and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.

I've made my code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices. I've also implemented a feature to send emails through a form on my website.

My portfolio is designed to be responsive across all devices, ensuring that everyone can access and appreciate my work. I've improved my site's performance using Suspense and Preload, providing a seamless experience for users.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio.
